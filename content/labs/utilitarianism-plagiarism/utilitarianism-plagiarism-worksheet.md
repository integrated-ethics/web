## Two Questions

1. Suppose that each group must submit a 6 page paper on the
history of Riemann Integration and that each group member will get the
same grade regardless of participation. Discuss how to complete the
assignment in a way that brings about the most happiness for the most
people.

2. Consider the following solution to completing homework
assignments based on the framework that your group was assigned. It
could be utilitarianism, virtue ethics, or deontology. Be prepared to
present your evaluation of the solution to the class.

    **Solution:**  Suppose you’re taking Calculus II, 
    the add deadline has just passed and
you’ve decided to change to a major that doesn't require Calculus II.
However, since it's too late to add another course and you need the
units for financial aid, you decide to finish Calculus II. There is a
lot of homework in this class and homework counts for a third of your
overall course grade. You have discovered that the solutions to all the
homework questions are on Chegg. You pay money for full access to the
solutions on Chegg and use it to complete the homework. Because you are
so busy with your other courses, most of the time you just copy the
solutions straight from Chegg without working out the solutions first.

    a. Is this an ethical approach? According to your assigned framework, why
or why not?

    b. An added twist: Does your answer change if the professor says "If the
class average for homework scores is too low, I’ll curve the homework
grade for everyone"?
